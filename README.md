# AI-Powered Autonomous Shopping & Personal Assistant — MVP

This repository contains a minimal MVP for:
- tracking grocery stock at home (inventory)
- recommending items when below threshold
- loading shop price data from CSV for price comparison
- simple React frontend with login + inventory UI

## Structure
- backend/       — Node.js + Express backend (SQLite)
- frontend/      — React (Vite) frontend (source)
- README.md

## Quick start (backend)
1. Open a terminal in `backend/`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run import-csv` to import sample CSV into the SQLite DB (or use API)
4. Run `npm start` (server on port 4000)

## Quick start (frontend)
1. Open a terminal in `frontend/`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev` (Vite dev server)
4. The frontend expects the backend at http://localhost:4000 — change `VITE_API_URL` in frontend `.env` if needed.

## Notes
- This is an MVP skeleton: enhance validation, error handling, security (store secrets properly), and add mail/imap features.
- Use `.env` or environment variables in production for JWT_SECRET and other credentials.
